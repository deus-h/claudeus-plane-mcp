## Plane Instance Configuration Security

When configuring Plane instances:

1. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Keep API tokens and credentials secure
3. Use proper access control settings
4. Regularly rotate access tokens

Add the following to your `plane-instances.json`:
```json
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "name": "example",
      "url": "https://plane.example.com",
      "apiKey": "process.env.PLANE_API_KEY"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Never commit actual API keys or sensitive data. Always use environment variables.
