## 🎸 Claude Desktop Integration

### Configuration Location
The Claude Desktop configuration file can be found at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: If you already have other MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop, DO NOT directly copy our example file as it will overwrite your existing configuration! Instead:

1. **For existing Claude Desktop users**:
   - Open your existing config through Claude Desktop:
     - Click on the Claude menu
     - Select "Settings..."
     - Click on "Developer" in the lefthand bar
     - Click on "Edit Config"
   - OR open your config file directly in a text editor
   - Add our Claudeus Plane MCP server configuration to your existing `mcpServers` object

2. **For new Claude Desktop users**:
   You can copy our example config file:
   ```bash
   # For macOS
   cp claude_desktop_config.json.example ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

   # For Windows (in PowerShell)
   Copy-Item claude_desktop_config.json.example $env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

### Configuration Examples

#### NPX Setup
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudeus-plane-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "claudeus-plane-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_INSTANCES_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/plane-instances.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Docker Setup 🐳
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudeus-plane-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--network=host",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/absolute/path/to/your/plane-instances.json,dst=/app/plane-instances.json",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/absolute/path/to/your/.env,dst=/app/.env",
        "mcp/plane",
        "--config", "/app/plane-instances.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> 🎸 Pro Tip: Make sure to replace `/absolute/path/to/your/plane-instances.json` with the actual path to your configuration file!

### After Configuration
1. Restart Claude Desktop completely
2. Look for the hammer 🔨 icon in the bottom right corner of the input box
3. Click it to see available Plane management tools
4. Start shredding! 🤘

### Troubleshooting
If the server isn't showing up in Claude:
1. Verify your `claude_desktop_config.json` syntax
2. Ensure file paths are absolute and valid
3. Check Claude's logs at:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`

## ⚠️ Issues and Considerations

### Current Limitations and Workarounds

#### 1. Claude Desktop Response Limits
- **Issue**: Claude Desktop's maximum response length can be reached during complex operations
- **Impact**: Operations may be interrupted, requiring user intervention
- **Workaround**: 
  - Configure Claude Desktop to break tasks into smaller batches
  - In Claude Desktop Settings > Advanced:
    - Set "Maximum Response Length" to a lower value
    - Enable "Auto-split Responses"
  - Use the Inspector UI for large-scale operations

#### 2. Rate Limiting Considerations
- **Issue**: Plane API has rate limits
- **Impact**: Bulk operations might be throttled
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use batch processing features
  - Implement appropriate delays between requests
  - Monitor API response headers for rate limit info

#### 3. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Large operations can consume significant memory
- **Impact**: Potential performance degradation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor system resources during large operations
  - Use pagination for large datasets
  - Implement cleanup routines

### Future Improvements
We're actively working on:
1. Improved response handling in Claude Desktop
2. Advanced rate limiting management
3. Memory optimization techniques
4. Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

### The Project Manager's Anthem
#### *by Amadeus & Claude*
---
*In Plane's vast space,  
Tasks flow with grace,  
AI's embrace,  
Sets perfect pace.*

*Through Claude's might,  
Projects take flight,  
In code's delight,  
All syncs just right.*

*A manager's dream,  
Where AI and team,  
Work upstream,  
Like metal's gleam.*
